I am Pranjal. This is my digital terrarium.

I currently consult on venture operations and AI-enabled services. I was previously part of the operations team at Sequoia Capital, and worked at law firms prior to that. You can read about my work [ here]({% link _posts/Miscellaneous/2026-01-01-Work.markdown %}).

A few links to explore:
- Coding and other [Projects](/projects/)
- [Creative Writing](/writing/)
- [Training](/training/) logs and race reports 
- Adventures in the [Mountains](/mountains/)
- Record of [Music](/music/), [Books](/books/), and [Movies](/movies/)

For how I use AI in my writing, please see [this post]({% link _posts/Miscellaneous/2024-01-01-how-i-use-ai.markdown %}).
