## Training

My training cycle for this race ran from **August ’25 to January ’26**. I had run the NICE Road 10K in July ’25 and was shocked to find it hard to run even 1 km at a stretch. I was ~93 kg and shin splints were a constant companion if I ran any distance faster than 7:00/km.

A late-July trek to **Pin Bhabha Pass** helped kickstart my base fitness, and I decided to build on that once back in Bangalore.

---

### August

I had only a vague notion of running a long-distance race later in the year and was unsure how my body would handle increased mileage. I chose the Kodagu HM in September as an intermediate goal.

Given how under-adapted my body was to running, I framed training around **time on feet** rather than distance. Running, walking, and cycling were used interchangeably, with strength training forming a key pillar.

**Stats:**  
- Running: 30 km  
- Walking: 30 km  
- Cycling: 60 km  
- Strength: 6 sessions  

---

### September

September followed a similar structure. Weight dropped slightly (~90 kg), but shin splints persisted. I managed 10–12 km runs without stressing my aerobic system and had two faster-paced runs (6:10/km) with Shouvik, which boosted confidence.

Kodagu HM (Sep 21):  
- **Time:** 2:39  
- **Pace:** 7:28/km  

This was an improvement over 2024 (2:51), though still short of my 2023 best (2:34). The aerobic engine felt intact; the legs were the limiting factor.

**Stats:**  
- Walking: 60 km  
- Running: 60 km  
- Cycling: 50 km  
- Strength: 3 sessions  

---

### October

October was a solid training month. I targeted the inaugural Mysore HM. Long runs topped out at ~15 km, with treadmill tempo sessions and weekly track work added.

Most long runs were at ~8:30/km—my sustainable Zone 2 pace at the time.

Mysore HM result:  
- **Time:** 2:44  
- **Pace:** 7:34/km  

Disappointing due to extended walking, but instructive.

**Stats:**  
- Running: 90 km  
- Walking: 20 km  
- Cycling: 40 km  
- Strength: 3 sessions  

---

### November

With Bangalore Ultra 35K in December as the next target, November focused on extending long runs to 20 km (twice). Shin splints were manageable, and weekly mileage finally stabilized around 25 km.

**Stats:**  
- Running: 100 km  
- Walking: 20 km  
- Strength: 5 sessions  

---

### December

The highlight was **Bangalore Ultra (37.5K)** at GKVK. After a fatigue-heavy run on Dec 1, I treated the first half of December as a taper.

Race day (Dec 21):  
- **Distance:** ~38 km  
- **Time:** ~5:15  

I stayed in Zone 2 throughout, with no shin issues. Confidence was high going into TMM.

## Pre-race

Arrived in Mumbai on Jan 16. No shakeout run due to lack of gym and poor pavement options. Instead, I walked ~10 km on both Friday and Saturday exploring the city.

Diet was relaxed but reasonable. Minor GI discomfort race morning resolved quickly. Breakfast was oats and a Snickers, followed by a walk to the CST holding area.

## Race

### KM 1–10 *(CSMT to Haji Ali)*  
*CST → Flora Fountain → Oval Maidan → Churchgate → Marine Drive*

Great spectator support early on. Settled into rhythm by KM 3. Finished 10K in ~70 min at ~7:00–7:10/km. Conserved energy knowing Peddar Road lay ahead.

---

### KM 10–30 *(Coastal Road + Sea Link)*  
*Peddar Road → Haji Ali → Coastal Road → Worli → Bandra → Mahim*

Surprisingly strong on inclines. Held goal pace (~7:10/km) until ~22K. The Sea Link induced some mental fatigue; pace naturally drifted toward ~8:15/km. Ran largely on feel rather than the watch.

---

### KM 30–42 *(Return via Coastal Road & Peddar Road)*

Ramps were tough but runnable. Found a second wind after 35K. Aiming for sub-5 became unrealistic due to distance discrepancies. Finished 40K at ~5 hr on the watch, slowed deliberately thereafter, and ran the final stretch to meet Mama near Churchgate.

- **Official time:** 5:31  
- **Watch time (extra distance):** ~5:15

## Post-race

### Things I’m happy about
- Ran almost the entire distance; legs felt strong.
- Nutrition and hydration worked well.
- Incredible route and spectator support—deeply emotional.

### Things I’m not happy about
- Finished well outside my stretch goal. Better pacing and experience could improve this, but this is a minor gripe.

Lunch at Ideal Corner with Ma capped off an excellent experience. Already itching for the next race.
