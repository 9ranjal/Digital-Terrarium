[Aanae](https://www.aanae.com/) is a best-in-class chatbot for UPSC/PSC preparation, powered by a custom-built pipeline that combines structure-aware chunking, semantic enrichment, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver grounded, context-aware answers.

*Aanae* means **“elephant”** in Kannada. The symbolism is intentional: an elephant’s memory and brain. Aanae is meant to function as a **second brain**—a system that remembers, retrieves, and helps reason over what you’ve already learned.
