## Where I Use AI

I use AI for **technical documentation** around my coding projects, mainly to externalise what already exists implicitly in the code.

In practice, this means using AI to help write:
- Clear descriptions of *what the code is doing* and *why it exists*;
- Explanations of control flow, data flow, and key abstractions;
- Notes on assumptions, constraints, and edge cases;
- Walkthroughs that map files, functions, and modules to their roles.

## Where I Do Not Use AI

I do not use AI for:
- Creative writing (stories, poetry);
- Experiential writing (essays, reports, reviews, personal reflections).
