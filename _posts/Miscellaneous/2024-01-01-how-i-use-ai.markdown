I graduated from **WBNUJS** in 2016. Some tidbits:

- I was the last person on the general merit list; had almost booked my tickets for NLIU Bhopal when I got the mail saying I'd cleared NUJS.
- I got debarred in my first exam of law school (Contracts I).
- I was the first person in my batch to land a job (a firm run by alumni showed up for on-campus interviews ahead of Day Zero).

## Work Experience  
*(in reverse chronological order)*

### Now — Independent Consulting *(Nov 2024 – Present)*

I consult for venture operations, and AI-enabled services. Some of the work I have done over the past year:

- Advised an AI-native law firm on the deployment of automated transactional systems. This entailed helping them design their LangChain and LangGraph frameworks while also developing their AI Governance / human-in-the-loop protocol.
- Audited legal data pipelines for a start-up aiding private credit workflows: contributed to context-engineering and RAG design aimed at pushing accuracy from ~80% to >90% for document analysis and alerts.

### Sequoia Capital (India & SEA) *(March 2021 – October 2024)*

- This was my dream job. Fund roles are very competitive / rare, and I had no reason to think I'd ever get to interview for a role here.
- In 2021, Sequoia Capital ran a parallel analyst program for its operations team. I'm given to understand 2xxx people applied. I was selected along with 2 others and given a 2-year contract.
- 2021 and 2022 were spent trying to keep my head above water. I'd joined just after they'd raised a $2.8B fund—significant capital was deployed during this period.
- In 2023, I was asked to continue in my role, i.e. given a full-time position. The focus shifted from capital deployment to portfolio management. I completed my CFA L1 around this time.
- In 2024, I switched focus to internal systems and processes. This is when my interest in data analytics emerged. I realised that the operations team was sitting on a treasure trove of data; I designed internal reporting and deal-operations workflows using Power Query / Power BI and Python, and built a single-source-of-truth pipeline that gave investors and other stakeholders real-time visibility on status across 100+ live deals. This allowed us to both triage (why did a deal take long) and predict (where bottlenecks were likely to emerge).
- Towards the end of 2024, I felt the need to move on and pursue independent projects. I had seen the full lifecycling of a fund (raise to harvest), and felt my learning outcomes would be better served if I were to take the time to learn AI on my own time / dime while consulting. This is what I do now.

### AZB & Partners *(November 2019 – February 2021)*

- A running refrain throughout law school / my early career was that I had no idea what the inside of a Tier 1 law firm looks like. My time at AZB & Partners settled that score.
- I worked in the general corporate & transactions team. I got my taste of big-ticket M&A and Private Equity transactions. Crucially, I saw how enormous billion-dollar deals could be abstracted down to nuts-and-bolts workflows.
- I had a very memorable detour helping set up a ~200 MW power plant in Rajasthan. At the time, it was one of the largest solar facilities in the country. To do my job well, I had to learn everything about how a solar facility operates—from the solar panels themselves to supply-chain hijinks.

### Lexygen *(November 2017 – October 2019)*

- Lexygen is a boutique firm specialising in VC transactions. I had very patient mentors who taught me how to execute transactions.
- Lexygen works with leading consumer VCs, and it's always gratifying to walk down a supermarket aisle and know that I helped with the funding rounds for Epigamia, Veeba, Sula Wines, and others.

### Zehn *(July 2016 – October 2017)*

- Zehn was a boutique law firm set up by alumni from WBNUJS. At the time I joined, they were effectively a captive unit for Uber to run its public policy and government engagement as it launched its operations in South India. Uber's story is a classic RegTech tale of trying to fit tech-enabled operations into legacy regulations—the work I did here has informed my perspective on this space.
- I also worked with GoK on implementing their Start-up Policy 2015–20, along with helping them operationalise their marquee investment platform—Idea2PoC. Happy to see this still going strong today.
